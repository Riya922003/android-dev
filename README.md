# Simple Calculator App

Welcome to my first Android application project! 🎉 This is a simple calculator app built using Android Studio, and it includes basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app has a clean and user-friendly interface designed to perform calculations easily on any Android device.

## 📱 Introduction

The **Simple Calculator App** is a lightweight and easy-to-use calculator designed for basic arithmetic operations. This project marks my first venture into Android app development, and I have implemented it using Java for the logic and XML for the interface. Whether you need to quickly add, subtract, multiply, or divide, this app has got you covered.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: All the core functionality and business logic of the calculator are implemented in Java.
- **XML**: The user interface (UI) is designed using XML to create an intuitive and minimalistic layout.

## 🖼️ Preview

Here’s a quick preview of how the app looks:
